# Arduino Wireless Sensor Network Setup

Welcome to the Arduino Wireless Sensor Network Setup repository. This project provides code samples and guidance on how to send commands to Arduino devices, essential for setting up a wireless sensor network. You can choose between two methods: using character arrays (char arrays) or strings, depending on your project's needs.

## Introduction

Setting up a wireless sensor network with Arduino devices requires efficient command processing. This repository offers code examples and explanations for two common methods of sending and processing commands: char arrays and strings. Understanding both approaches will help you tailor your project to your specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download this repository to your local machine. You will need the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
3. Open the code samples provided in the `char_array` and `string` folders.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Using Char Arrays

The `SendCharCMD` folder contains code samples that demonstrate how to send and process commands using character arrays (char arrays). Char arrays are memory-efficient and suitable for projects with limited resources.

## Using Strings

The `SendStringCMD` folder contains code samples that show how to send and process commands using strings. Strings offer flexibility and ease of use when working with text-based commands but consume more memory.

## Choosing the Right Approach

Your choice between char arrays and strings depends on your project's requirements. If memory efficiency is crucial, char arrays are recommended. If you prioritize ease of use and readability, strings are a better fit.
